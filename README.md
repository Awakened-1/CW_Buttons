# CW_Buttons
TM Script to add buttons to the CW video interface

Many videos can not be played on CW and throw an error: "HTML5: file not found" or different errors.

Sometimes the file is actually missing. Or sometimes the file is corrupted. But on occassion, a video

file can be retrieved. These buttons help determine if there is a video link (URL), and if so, help you 

get it and hopefully the associated video file.
